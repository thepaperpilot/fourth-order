###Intro###
King
Noble champion, I have for you an important task.
The guardians of the Pentagonal Table have united under the banner of "The Fourth Order" and are terrorizing my kingdom.

Knight
What is my quest?

King
You must go out and put a stop to this madness. Defeat the five guardians of the Fourth Order and restore this land's peace.
This will be no easy task. In order to defeat these masters of the elements, you will need to learn them yourself.
Will you become a deadly Ranger, mortally wounding your foes with pinpointed strikes?
Or a sturdy Paladin, able to withstand injuries with the help of healing steam?
Perhaps a mysterious Wizard, manipulating the physical world using masonic secrets?
Or still yet a clever Alchemist, concocting alchemical poisons to weaken your foes?
If not then maybe a stealthy Rogue, capitalizing on your enemy's surprise?

Knight
>
My aim is true. Ranger it is!
>
No enemy can fell me as a righteous Paladin!
>
I will discover ancient secrets as a Wizard!
>
None will be impervious to my Alchemist concoctions!
>
Nobody will expect me if I go Rogue!
>
I'm not sure... can you repeat that? (go to line 11)

King
Excellent. I wish you luck... the fate of this kingdom lies in your hands!

##Confront Ranger
Knight
Halt! Your reign of terror ends here!

Ranger
Not so fast! You may have managed to hunt me down,
but don't jump so quickly to conclude which one of us is the prey!
I hope you've brought good armor, because I'm the guardian of the Mortal element.
That means I know just how to inflict the worst injuries! Still eager to fight me?

Knight
>
Bring it on!
>
Think you can scare me that easily?

##Lose to Ranger
Ranger
Hah! Too easy. Lick your wounds and come challenge me again when you've got game.

#Defeat Ranger
Ranger
Ouch, you're tougher than I though! Fine, I yield!
I guess I have to go hunt for something better to do now...
Feel free to come back here if you ever want to train your aim!

##Confront Alchemist
Knight
You! Cease your vile brews at once!

Alch
Hmmm... I disagree. If you wish me to stop my craft then you'll need a better reason.

Knight
>
I'll beat you up, nerd!
>
I'll show you how a true hero fights!

Alch
Hehe, how amusing. Here, I'll make a deal with you:
If you can defeat me, I'll quit bothering you, blah blah.
But if you lose, well then.....
...Then I'll get to laugh at you! Hahaha!

##Lose to Alchemist
Alch
Just what I expected, you're all fumes and no mettle.
Come back when you've transmuted yourself into sterner stuff!

#Defeat Alchemist
Eureka! That was quite an impressive fight, but I appear to have lost.
Well... don't worry, I will uphold my part of the deal.
Don't hesitate to come back and help me with my research...
...if you'd like to discover new ways to lose to me! Hahahaha!

##Confront Paladin
Knight
You! Quit.... uhh... healing people?
Whatever you're doing that's wrong, stop it!

Paladin
No! I joined the Fourth Order so that I could make sure there were
always patients to test out my new healing machines on.
I'm not going to let your little 'honor' get in the way of my breakthrough!

Knight
>
Couldn't you just wait for people to get hurt?
>
Why not just use your healing magic?

Paladin
That would take too long! Speaking of which, stop wasting my time.
Fight me or leave!

##Lose to Paladin
Paladin
Hah! My machines could fight harder than that and they're for HEALING.
Come challenge me again when you're strong enough not to make a fool of yourself!

##Defeat Paladin
Okay, fine- You beat me! I'll stop helping these Fourth Order guys.
My prototype is almost finished anyway.
If you'd ever like to help me test it out, just come back here
and I can dispense you some more bandaids!

#Confront Wizard
Knight
Hey, you!

Wizard
...

Knight
>
I'm uh... here to stop you?
>
Don't talk much?

Wizard
...

Knight
...Right then. I suppose we must battle?

Wizard

#Lose to Wizard
Wizard

Knight
Yeah yeah, I know. "Come back when you are stronger" and stuff.

Wizard

##Defeat Wizard
Wizard
...

Knight
I know you aren't talking but look, just stop attacking people, okay?
I'll be back here to check on you if you don't!

Wizard
...

##Confront Rogue
Rogue
Hi-yah!

Knight
>
Woah, where'd you come from!
>
Who are you!?!

Rogue
Hah! sneaking up on you was easy, for I am the guardian of the element of Surprise!
You've practically walked into my trap, now prepare for battle!

#Lose to Rogue
Hah! You're as WEAK as you are UNOBSERVANT and CLUMSY!
Come fight me again when you're skilled enough to not tarnish your honor!

#Defeat Rogue
Woah, you beat me! I'm surprised... What brings you here anyway?

Knight
I need for you to stop attacking people... like you just did.

Rogue
Aww man... that's no fun, but I guess I'll follow along.
Hey you're a pretty good fighter, mind stopping by to spar sometime?
